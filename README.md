# littleagenda
A clearly not perfect , but usable php calendar, it uses a sqlite datase for storing events.


Events are created by goig to http://path.to.script/agenda.php?newevent=PASSWORD
then filling the form and submitting. 

PASSWORD is a password in php code, you can change it at line 25 : define("PASSWORD",<your own>)

lot of work to do before it's totally reliable.

day in months aren't ajusted , an event just after the new year wont be show...

Graphical interface is really basic and can be better
